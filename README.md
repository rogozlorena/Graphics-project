# Graphics project implemented in Lisp
I chose to create a program that makes modifications to circles with various radii.
To test the created program, it is necessary to generate multiple circles with different radii. After running the program, circles with a radius smaller than the number 2 will be colored with a user-selected color, while circles with a radius greater than 5 will be deleted.
